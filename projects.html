              <h3>Image Compression Tools</h3>
              <p>
                I designed and helped a team of four build a system Using C# and
                .NET to take files of medical images and run diagnostic tests on
                them. The system outputs data files on the detail loss and file
                size savings on any sets and combinations of compression
                algorithms you want.
              </p>
              <p>
                Medical images are often 16-bit grayscale images with large
                filesizes. These large sizes slow image transfer on networks,
                especially those at battlefields. This system is deigned to find
                compression algroithms that do the best job for each individual
                medical image, while keeping the images from losing important
                details.

              <h3>Malware Project</h3>
              <p>
                On a team of three, using C and C++, I helped build a system
                that lets a user use a shell for another computer remotely. This
                process is hidden from the main computer, including from the
                process list.
              </p>
              <p>
                My job was to build the parser that takes commands from the
                remote computer and executes them on the host. The parser also
                sent the information the host produced and translated it back
                for the remote computer.

              <h3>Hackathon Survey Application</h3>
              <p>
                I built a working prototype of a survey system app where an
                admin user can upload a survey (like a straw poll) and then
                distribute it among a selected group of people on their mobile
                devices. The poll results could then be stored on a local
                account where the poll results can be archived and viewed with
                previous polls.
              </p>

              <h3>Mobile App Game</h3>
              <p>
                I built a app which can randomly generate a solvable puzzle of
                any dimensions of the classic "lights out" game. The game can
                also show you what you need to do to solve it from any game
                state, of which there are 2^n different combinations. With a
                large enough board, my app can solve a puzzle that has more
                different states than chess.
