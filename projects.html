              <h3>Image Compression Tools</h3>
              <p>
                Medical images tend to use a 16-bit grayscale images with large
                filesizes. This can lead to slow image transfer on networks,
                especially those at battlefields. On a team of four, I designed
                and helped build a system to find image compression algroithms
                that do the best job for each individual medical image, while
                keeping the images from losing important details.
              </p>
              <p>
                This system uses C# and .NET to take files of medical images and
                run diagnostic tests on them. This gathers and outputs data
                files on the detail loss and file size savings on any sets of
                compression algorithms you want.

              <h3>Malware Project</h3>
              <p>
                On a team of three, using C and C++, we built a system that lets
                a user use a shell for another computer remotely. This process
                is hidden from the main computer, including from the process
                list.
              </p>
              <p>
                My job was to build the parser that takes commands from the
                remote computer and executes them on the host. The parser also sent the information the host produced and translated it back for the remote computer.

              <h3>Hackathon Survey Application</h3>
              <p>
                Built a working prototype of a survey system app where an admin
                user can upload a survey (like a straw poll) and then distribute
                it among a selected group of people on their mobile devices.
                The poll results could then be stored on a local account where the poll results can be archived and viewed with previous polls.

              <h3>Mobile App Game</h3>
              <p>
                I built a app which can randomly generate a
                solvable puzzle of any dimensions of the classic "lights out" game. The game can also show you what you need to do to solve it from any game state, of which there are 2^n different combinations, which with a large enough board, is more states than in chess.
