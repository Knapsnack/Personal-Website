              <h3>Image Compression Tool</h3>
              <p>
                On a team of 4, We built a C# based system that builds
                spreadsheets of data by mixing and matching combinations of
                image pre-processers and compressors on 16-bit gray-scale tiff
                images. The tool is to be used in research on medical images to
                find out which combinations do the best job on various kinds of
                medical images at both preserving data.

              <h3>Malware Project</h3>
              <p>
                For my computer systems class, my 3-man team built a remote
                shell that hides itself from the process list on an infected
                computer. The infected computer pings out a hidden signaling
                process that allows us to access the computer terminal commands
                remotely and undetected.
              </p>

              <h3>Hackathon Survey Application</h3>
              <p>
                Built a working prototype of a survey system app where an admin
                user can upload a survey (like a straw poll) and then distribute
                it among a selected group of people on their mobile devices.
                This poll could then be stored on a local account where the user
                can view data from their polls and previous polls.
              </p>

              <h3>Personal Mobile App Design Project</h3>
              <p>
                I built a “Lights Out puzzle” app which can randomly generate a
                solvable, puzzle of user selected dimensions that fits any
                screen, as well as providing a solution if the user wants one.
